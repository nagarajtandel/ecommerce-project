🛒 Ecom-Insight: SQL + Python Ecommerce Analytics
🔍 About the Project

Ecom-Insight is a data-driven analysis project where I combined the querying power of SQL with the visualization capabilities of Python. Using a real Ecommerce dataset, I explored customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends to uncover insights that can guide business decisions.

This project demonstrates how structured queries and clear visualizations can turn raw data into meaningful strategies for growth, retention, and profitability.

🗂 Project Workflow
1. Data Setup

Dataset: Public Ecommerce dataset from Kaggle

Files: Customers, products, orders, and payments (CSV format)

Storage: Loaded into a MySQL database for structured analysis

👉 Dataset Link

2. Tools & Tech

Database: MySQL

Query Interface: SQL Workbench

Analysis & Viz: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries:

pandas – data wrangling

matplotlib, seaborn – visual storytelling

mysql-connector-python – SQL to Python bridge

3. Core Activities

SQL Queries: Simple to advanced extractions (sales by city, category revenue, customer loyalty).

Python Analysis: Extra metrics like moving averages, retention %, and YoY growth.

Visualizations: Trend lines, category comparisons, and heatmaps for business clarity.

📈 Highlights of the Analysis

Basic Insights

Which cities bring in the most customers

Sales split by product categories

Order counts by year

Intermediate Insights

Monthly sales trend analysis

Average order size by region

🚀 Skills Gained

Hands-on integration of SQL + Python

Practical use of Ecommerce KPIs (retention, CLV basics, sales growth)

Data-to-decision pipeline: raw CSV → SQL queries → Python analysis → clear insights

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add predictive modeling (e.g., churn prediction, CLV forecasting)

Explore real-time dashboards for ongoing monitoring

Extend analysis to recommendation systems

💡 This project reflects my ability to not just query and clean data, but also transform it into insights that are meaningful to business growth.

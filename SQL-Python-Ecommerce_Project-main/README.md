# **Ecom-Insight : Ecommerce Data Analysis Project with SQL and Python**

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project showcases a complete data analysis pipeline, utilizing SQL for data extraction and Python for data visualization and insights generation. The dataset comes from a large-scale Ecommerce platform, and the goal was to derive key business insights through structured queries and visual analysis.

By blending the power of **SQL Workbench** for database management and **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for analysis and visualizations, this project highlights my ability to work across different tools and technologies in data science. The insights drawn from this dataset could inform critical business decisions, such as customer retention strategies, sales optimization, and revenue growth forecasting.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**

### **1. Dataset**
- **Source**: A comprehensive Ecommerce dataset, including customer orders, product details, and payment information.
- **Format**: CSV files stored locally and ingested into a MySQL database for structured querying.
- **Dataset-link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv

### **2. Tools and Technologies**
- **SQL Workbench**: Used to run queries and extract insights from the dataset.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Employed for connecting to the SQL database, performing advanced analysis, and visualizing the results.
- **MySQL**: Database management for storing and querying the Ecommerce data.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL interaction.

### **3. Key Features**
- **SQL Querying**: 
  - Extracted detailed insights with multiple levels of complexity (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced queries).
  - Queries include data on customer location, sales performance, product category revenue, customer retention, and more.
  
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Used **Python** to compute additional metrics like moving averages, year-over-year growth, and customer retention rates.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Presented key business insights through compelling visualizations (bar plots, line graphs, heatmaps) to enhance data understanding and decision-making.
